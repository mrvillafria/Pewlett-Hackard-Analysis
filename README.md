# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using Structured Query Language, also known as SQL, to organize and query our data. SQL is one of the most commonly used query languages that will help us perform our analysis to discover relationships between our data in a database. In order to design and build our database, we will also need to understand how to organize our data. To visualize the flow of information, we will create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) that will show the database as a whole but also highlights the tables and their relationships. Although there are many different interfaces to use SQL, we will be using Postgres and pgAdmin in this project. We'll be using Postgres as our relational database system where we will be loading our data into. PgAdmin is the user-friendly interface that interacts specifically with Postgres and where we will be writing and executing our queries.
